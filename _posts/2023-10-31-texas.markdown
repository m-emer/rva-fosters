Skywalker used to be the biggest kitten, but some stomach issues (on the path to recovery now!) caused him to lose a lot of weight since he had no appetite - he had to spend several nights in the SPCA's medical ward. :( Since his recovery, he's really blossomed as a sweet, even-tempered kitten who is getting his old spunk back.

He is very protecctive of his smaller brothers and will step in if somebody is getting bullied (unless he's too busy sleeping - nothing wakes this guy up). He is very independent and happy doing his own thing - a great companion for somebody busier!
