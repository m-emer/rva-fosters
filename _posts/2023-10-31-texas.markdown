Skywalker used to be the biggest kitten, but some stomach issues (on the path to recovery now!) caused him to lose a lot of weight since he had no appetite - he had to spend several nights in the SPCA's medical ward. :( Since his recovery, he's really blossomed as a sweet, chill kitten who is getting his old spunk back.

Even though he's smaller than he used to be, Skywalker doesn't know that - he's the first to growl at suspicious sounds and has appointed himself the guardian against any dogs that he sees outside. He is very protecctive of his smaller brothers and will step in if somebody is getting bullied (unless he's too busy sleeping - nothing wakes this guy up). Overall, he is an independent guy happy doing his own thing - a great companion for somebody busier!
