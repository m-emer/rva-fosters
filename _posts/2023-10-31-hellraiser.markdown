Thrawn is often confused with his brother Skywalker at first glance, but Thrawn has a truly one-of-a-kind personality. He is downright fearless and will run right up to a stranger for attention, and is even unafraid of dogs and other cat's he sees through the window.

He would be great for an extrovert with lots of friends over - there's nothing he can't handle!
