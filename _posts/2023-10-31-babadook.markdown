Syndalla is a quirky kitten - he's often lost in his own little worlds. He tends towards being relaxed and enjoys climbing up shirts and playing with hair. He's the perfect middle-of-the-road kitten - will cuddle if you pick him up, but totally chill being on his own. 

Syndalla is also known for being super quiet - even when his brothers are causing a ruckus and yelling you won't hear a peep out of him!
