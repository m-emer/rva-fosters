There's really no better way to describe Enoch than "happy-go-lucky". He is friendly, undisturbed by pretty much anything that comes his way, and loves to cuddle with his brothers and sister. 

He is very curious and adventurous - he's the only kitten who is able to break out of their playpen. He was also the first one who was brave enough to fall asleep on a person - when he was just a tiny baby :')
